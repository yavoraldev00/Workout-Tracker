## Summary

This is a fitness tracker web app. With it, users can create an account, make their own workouts and track their exercise progress. I built this app using NextJS and Supabase, so I can practice and learn how to make more complicated React apps.



## Features

### Workout template creation

Create your own workout plan by selecting exercises and setting the number of sets reps and weight

### Workout mode

While working out, track the progress of your exercises by filling in your exercise load. The app shows you your previous workout's statistics and displays your highest volume and weight lifted
